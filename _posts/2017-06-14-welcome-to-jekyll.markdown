It's been about a year since I last updated my personal website, so I figured it was time to start fresh. They last one was built with hexo and deployed to AWS. This time around I went the easy route and built it in jekyll and deployed it to github. I was going through the codecademy courses as a refresher and figured, hey why not go ahead and rebuild my site with their [deploy a site][deploy] course. 

Since I last built my website I have moved to VScode and have been really trying to focus getting javascript under my belt. I'm hoping to start tackling some React projects soon which I want to host on my site here. 

Well I don't want to get too bogged down in promises as that usually leads to me abandon whatever project I was working on. 

So till next time,
Jake
